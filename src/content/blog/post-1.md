## I've found the perfect Tupperware. âœ…

Like most 20-somethings transitioning into their 30s, I owned a hodgepodge of Tupperware, ranging from cheap IKEA sets to nicer storage containers not given back to older family members after leaving some holiday event. My collection was like I assume yours is very large and... very miss matched. While a few pieces were used regularly for one reason or another, the majority languished taking up a whole cabinet, rarely used because it was to hard to find a lid or the one lid it did have was a bit warped, and would not seal.

As I unpacked during a recent move, I pondered this problem, and turned my pragmatic brain on looking at a tub of salsa I bought from a local store I thought.... these are as nice as any of my IKEA storage containers, but are also given away with the cost of the food. They cant cost that much. Lets see, I was right. They are super cheap around $20-$50 for a large set.. As I was going to try making my own salsa ( this was right at the start of a huge salsa phase that I'm still in) I figured I would buy a pack and at least use it for my new salsas. Its been months now and I use deli containers as my only food storage and I think you should too. Let me go into some of the pragmatic reasons behind this and by the end I think you will also agree that these might be the very best food storage option out there.

**The One-Lid rule them all**

One of the biggest game-changers for me is the universal lid. No more trying out lids to find the right lid or realizing that out simply don't have a lid of this container you just dirtied. Theirs only a single lid size, making life so much easier.

**Size matters I swear**

Deli containers come in a few sizes 8,16,32oz so theirs a good size for you there. If you hade a huge pot of curry use two 32oz containers and your good.

**Rock solid design**

Deli containers have super tight-fitting lids that keep your food on the inside, even during bumpy car rides or accidental falls from fridge shelfs.

**Budget-Friendly and Eco-Friendly**

One of the my favorite things about deli containers is their affordability. So you don't do this because your a real adult but in my life I save left overs, and maybe some times forget about them, and keep forgetting about them. Then a few months later I have a bio-hazard bomb on my hands that I really don't want to open and clean out just to get back some dumb container. Fear not just throw the whole thing out.

**Larp as a Pro**

When I'm gifting some of my salsa's to friends and family, I love that the deli containers look store bought. It makes me look like I'm a salsa Pro just because I use the same container the Pros do use. They present food beautifully and make a great impression. Plus, there's no need to worry about getting them back. People don't ever thing " I have to remember to give this back to Cole".

**Meal Prep Made Easy**

Deli containers are pretty good for meal prep too. While the little black and clear rectangle containers are the go to. I like to portion out my left overs as little lunches making a layer cake of lunch (little bit of rice on the bottom, then some curry and some grilled chicken on top). Easy and if I was going to use separate containers anyway this saves me some work eating it next time.

If you're looking to simplify your kitchen and elevate your food storage game, I highly recommend giving deli containers a try. You won't regret it!
